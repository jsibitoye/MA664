I may not be able to grow flowers, but my garden produces just
as many dead leaves, old overshoes, pieces of rope, and bushels
of dead grass as anybodyâ€™s, and today I bought a wheelbarrow
to help in clearing it up. I have always loved and respected
the wheelbarrow. It is the one wheeled vehicle of which I am
perfect master.
